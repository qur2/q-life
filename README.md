q-life
======

## Genesis
I started this small project after seing [x-life](http://acrylc.github.io/2014/06/10/x-life/):

- Firstly, I wanted to know more about custom element.
- Secondly, I started to implement a game of life in javascript using two.js some time ago. Unfortunately, I somehow abandoned it.

It seemed a perfect way to address both points at once. So here I am, forking that project and ready to insert the bricks I already wrote.
Unfortunately, I soon notice that I am not even familiar with bower. So, after a bit more digging, I decided to start over using the [seed-element](http://polymerlabs.github.io/seed-element) component, which comes nicely set up and with a ready test suite (more [here](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/reusableelements.html)).

Fast forward and I hope you'll enjoy this q-life component.

## Ideas
Here are some ideas to improve the element that I may or may not implement in the future:

- Implement pentagon tiling game (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_tiling)
- Implement a wireworld game type (http://kaytdek.trevorshp.com/projects/computer/neuralNetworks/gameOfLife2.htm)
- Implement a 1D representation
- More attribute configuration (like the states)
