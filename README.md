q-life
======

## Genesis

I started this small project after seing [x-life](http://acrylc.github.io/2014/06/10/x-life/):
- Firstly, I wanted to know more about custom element.
- Secondly, I started to implement a game of life in javascript using two.js some time ago. Unfortunately, I somehow abandoned it.

It seemed a perfect way to address both points at once. So here I am, forking that project and ready to insert the bricks I already wrote.
Unfortunately, I soon notice that I am not even familiar with bower. So, after a bit more digging, I decided to start over using the [seed-element](http://polymerlabs.github.io/seed-element) component, which comes nice set up and with a ready test suite (more [here](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/reusableelements.html)).

Fast forward and I hope you'll enjoy this q-life component.
